- [3blue1brown: essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
  - This provides a great conceptual overview and awesome visualizations, I would recommend
  watching these videos first, and then again after you've completed some of the other links.
- [Khan Academy: least squares approximation](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/alternate-bases#orthogonal-projections)
  - A great complement to 3blue1brown, Sal walks through concrete examples of least squares approximation
  (which is essentially the linear algebra form of regression)
- [Introduction to Statistical Learning: Chapter 3](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf)
  - I've read the first three chapters in full, and the 3rd chapter on regression
  really opened up my understanding on how to interpret regression parameters
- [Elements of Statistical Learning: Chapter 3](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)
  - A more formal mathematical understanding of linear regression, I haven't finished this yet.
- [MumfordBrainStats: Regression overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H477w6E30eU&list=PLB2iAtgpI4YGqgEqpANztNBx0qGlzzrJt)
  - Great series by Jeanette to understand regression in the context of brain science
- [John Hopkins Data Science Track: Regression Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models/home/welcome)
  - Currently going through this class, so far it's awesome!
- [zstatistics: regression](http://www.zstatistics.com/videos/#/regression/)
  - I used their 2nd video to understand degrees of freedom more intuitively
